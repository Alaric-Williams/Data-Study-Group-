## Introduction to the Data Assessment App 

The data sensitivity app is used to record data sensitivty assessments and outcomes in order for a project sensitivity tier to be assighned. 

The web app and the safe haven are completely seperate, the web app generates what tier the project should be but is not connected to the safe haven or project data - its only purpose is to digitally logs assessmnets. Any generated tiers must be communicated to REG/IT so that they can match the environemnt used for the project to its sensitivity tier. 

As a project manager, you must set up new users, projects and work packages within the Data Assessment App so that PIs and data providers can simply log in and see what they have been assighned to do. 

## Background on the safe haven 

In case you are unfamiliar with the safe haven/ sensitivity tier model here is a quick summary. 

Safe havnes are secure research environments (SREs) used for analysis of sensitive datasets and are essential for research, giving data providers confidence that their datasets will be kept secure over the course of a project. Before the project can get started using a safe haven, the data/project must be assessent to understand its sensitivity, and how it should be handled and stored in a safe haven. 

There are different tiers of sensitivty, the higher the sensitivity tier the more resrictions will be in place in the enviroenmnet to protect the data. Please see the tabel below. 

For a safe haven tier to be assighned, the projects data provider and PI must answer questions about the project and data in the web app. A referee will also need to conduct the assessmnet if the tier outcome is 2 or above - just to be sure.

### Summary Table:

| Safe haven sensitivity tier | Data example | Environment features |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Tier 0 | Open data or data with no negative consequences if it was to be published | Access from any device, copy and paste function enables, intenet enabled |
| Tier 1 | Data with very limited consequences if it was to be published, such as data being held back from being published for research advantage | Access from any device, copy and paste function enables, intenet enabled |
| Tier 2 | Commercially sensitive data & strongly pseudonymised personal data | Access from any device, copy & paste function disabled, internet disabled | 
| Tier 3 | Personal data with weak or no pseudonymisation,  more sensitive commercial or government data | Access from know spaces and manged devices only, internet disabled, copy & paste function disbaled, white listed packages only |
| Tier 4 | Very sensitive personal, commercial or government data | Access only from known dedicated secure rooms and devices, internet disabled, copy & paste function disabeled, stricter white listed packages |
