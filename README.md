The Data Study Groups (DSG)
=====================


What are Data Study Groups?
===========================
Intensive five day 'collaborative hackathons' hosted at the Turing, which bring together organisations from industry, government, and the third sector, with talented multi-disciplinary researchers from academia.
Organisations act as Data Study Group 'Challenge Owners', providing real-world problems and datasets to be tackled by small groups of highly talented, carefully selected researchers.
Researchers brainstorm and engineer data science solutions, presenting their work at the end of the week.
